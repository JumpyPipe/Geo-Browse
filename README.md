# Bay Area ZIP Trend Dashboard

This project visualizes home furnishing trends by ZIP code across the Bay Area using an interactive web map.

### 🔍 Features
- Interactive map showing ZIP-level popularity trends
- Filter by ZIP Code, Style, and Material
- Inline GeoJSON data (fully self-contained, no external fetch required)
- Built using Leaflet.js and GitHub Pages

### 📁 Files in This Repo
- `index.html` — Main dashboard with embedded GeoJSON
- `README.md` — You're reading it!

### 🚀 How It Works
The dashboard loads all ZIP geometries and trend data directly from a JSON block embedded inside `index.html`. This avoids cross-origin or content-type issues common on GitHub Pages.
